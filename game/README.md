# Password Game #

## What it is about ##
How good are you at telling good and bad passwords apart?
 


## Rules ##

- You have 1 minute to rate randomly selected passwords on a scale from 1 (very weak) to 5 (very strong). 
 
- The game ends after 40 passwords. 

- After the game you see which ones you got right. 

## Background ##
- The idea is based on an experiment by Ur et al. (CHI 2016). 
- People have a specific bias when they overestimate / underestimate the strength of a password.
